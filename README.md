# GenAI Python Basics 🚀

This repository contains a series of beginner-level Python projects I’ve completed as part of my journey to become a Generative AI Engineer.

Each mini project is designed to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals like string manipulation, functions, list comprehensions, and more.
